# APP NAME

## 💡 Inspiration

## 💻 What it does

## ⚙️ How we built it

- React Js: For frontend
- Firebase: For backend
- Google Techable Machine: For ML and disease prediction
- i18n: For multi-language support
- Tailwind: For styling and animations

## 📚 Research

## 🔐 Use of Solana

## 📄 Use of GitHub

We used GitHub for version control and collaboration. We used [GitHub Project](https://github.com/Harshal0902/MLH-Fellowship-Orientation-Hackathon/projects/1) to plan our project. We used GitHub Issues to track bugs and issues. We used GitHub Pull Requests to track feature requests. We also used GitHub Actions to automate our CI/CD pipeline. GitHub Actions is a powerful tool that allows you to automate your CI/CD pipeline.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- As some of the teammates were from different time zones, it was a bit difficult to collaborate, but we managed to get the project done.
- Some of us did not have any experience with Machine Learning. We collaborated and helped each other get up to speed. We managed to get most features we want working.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Completing the project within the given time frame.
- Creating a fully functional application.

## 📖 What we learned

- How to use Google techable machine to predict the disease.
- How to use i18n to support multi-language support.
- How to use Tailwind to style and animate our application.

## 🚀 What's next for APP NAME

- Building a mobile application.
- Adding more disease prediction features.
- Improving the accuracy of our ML model.
